# FOOD ORDERS NEW DELHI ANALYSIS - OVERVIEW
This report examines 1,000 food delivery orders to analyze cost structure and profitability. It aims to identify key factors affecting financial performance and uncover strategic opportunities to improve efficiency and enhance overall profitability.

# OBJECTIVES OF THE ANALYSIS
The task is to conduct:
- Detailed Cost Analysis: Identify the major cost components associated with delivering food orders, including direct costs like delivery fees and indirect costs like discounts and payment processing fees.
- Profitability Evaluation: Calculate the profitability of individual orders and aggregating this data to assess overall profitability. This involves examining how revenue generated from commission fees measures against the total costs.
- Strategic Recommendations for Improvement: Based on the cost and profitability analysis, identify actionable strategies to reduce costs, adjust pricing, commission fees, and discount strategies to improve profitability. This includes finding a “sweet spot” for commission and discount percentages that ensures profitability across orders.
- Impact Simulation of Proposed Strategies: Simulate the financial impact of the recommended strategies on profitability, using the dataset to forecast how adjustments in commission rates and discount strategies could potentially transform current losses into profits.
